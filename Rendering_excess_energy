Summary: Reaching ~$100/month with 1–2 RTX 4070 on surplus solar
Objective
Generate approximately USD 100/month using 1–2 RTX 4070 GPUs, operated on surplus solar electricity, with remote operation from Europe/USA. The primary infrastructure (solar + batteries) is dimensioned for normal household use, not for mining.
1. Power & Infrastructure Assumptions
The solar system is sized for household resilience (lighting, internet, refrigeration, basic computing).
GPUs are secondary loads, running only when surplus power is available.
Primary guaranteed load: Starlink (~70 W).
GPUs are throttled or paused during:
low solar input
battery protection states
This avoids overbuilding the solar system purely for compute.
Key point:
The compute layer does not drive infrastructure cost — it monetises excess capacity.
2. Hardware: RTX 4070
Current cost (2026):
~USD 500–600 per GPU (new, varies by region)
Power draw:
~180–220 W under compute
can be underclocked to ~150 W for efficiency
Capabilities:
AI inference
light training
rendering
batch compute
edge workloads
3. Revenue Model (Realistic, Not Hype)
Traditional crypto mining alone is not sufficient or attractive long-term.
Revenue is assumed to be mixed workloads, e.g.:
AI inference / batch jobs
rendering
compute leasing
opportunistic mining during idle periods
Target:
~USD 50–70/month per RTX 4070
1–2 GPUs → ~USD 100/month combined, depending on utilisation.
This assumes:
non-24/7 operation
no grid electricity cost
low operating overhead
4. Depreciation & Asset Value
RTX 4070 depreciation is slow relative to income potential:
Time
Estimated resale value
New
100%
2 years
~65–70%
4 years
~40–50%
6 years
~25–35%
8+ years
residual / secondary use
GPUs remain useful long after peak performance.
After initial role, they can be repurposed as:
secondary compute nodes
render slaves
edge AI
educational / local workloads
Important:
The GPU is treated as a capital asset, not a consumable.
5. Strategic Rationale
Electricity is the dominant cost in compute.
Here it is near-zero marginal cost.
Solar infrastructure is justified independently of compute.
Compute monetisation is optional upside, not risk exposure.
Remote operation allows:
European / US clients
Global workloads
No local labour dependency
Conclusion
1–2 RTX 4070 GPUs are sufficient to target ~USD 100/month under realistic assumptions.
The system is:
capital-efficient
resilient
modular
scalable only if proven
Downside risk is limited to hardware depreciation, not recurring costs.
In short:
This is not “mining for profit”, but monetising surplus energy with flexible compute assets
